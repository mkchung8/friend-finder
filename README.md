# Pet Findr &hearts; 

Demo a live version on this application here: [https://node-pet-findr.herokuapp.com/]

Pet Findr is a compatability-based doggo finder application, similar to Tindr, designed to match the user with the most ideal dog type that fits their unique preferences. This web application takes input from the survey questionnaire and compares the user's result with all the dogs in the database to find the perfect pet match. 

The compatability survey consists of 10 questions, each answer with a score value between 1 and 10. The application then goes through each match, finding the total difference between the user value and potential match value. The best match is selected by choosing the match with the least amount of deviation between user and match scores. 

## Getting Started 

To begin using the application, start by clicking the link to the live demo version or clone the repository to your machine to deploy locally. 

Users are able to navigate to the survey from the home page or view all possible matches that are available. 
To fill out the survey, input your name into the form and select the best answer for each question. Click 'Submit' to reveal your best match.
